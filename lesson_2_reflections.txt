What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, a .git folder is created.

I need to do this so that git can keep track of changes I make using commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area gives a temporary space to decide which files are to be commited in which state, whilst not being a hinderance to the development process.
